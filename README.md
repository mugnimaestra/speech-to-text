## Deployment Considerations

### Vercel Deployment

The application is optimized for deployment on Vercel with the following considerations:

1. **File Size Limitations**

   - Direct file uploads are limited to 4MB due to Vercel's API route body size restriction
   - For files larger than 4MB, use the URL upload feature

2. **URL Upload Feature**
   - Not affected by Vercel's size limitations
   - Handles files up to 100MB
   - More efficient for larger files
   - Direct URL processing by Lemonfox.ai

### Alternative Deployment Options

For applications requiring larger direct file uploads, consider:

1. Using a cloud storage service (e.g., AWS S3) for initial file upload
2. Implementing client-side direct uploads to Lemonfox
3. Deploying to a platform without body size restrictions

## Error Handling

The application handles various error cases:

- Invalid file formats
- File size limits (with clear guidance on using URL upload for larger files)
- Invalid URLs
- API errors
- Network issues

Error messages are displayed clearly to the user with suggestions for resolution.
